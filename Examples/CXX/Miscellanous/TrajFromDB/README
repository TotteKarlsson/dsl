This is the directory for the dipmysql module.

The dipole-mysql is setup from a .ini file, supplied at the comman line, e.g
	->dipmysql -i./../config/Modules.ini
The required parameters to be set in the ini file are collected under the
[DIPOLE_MYSQL] place holder, i.e.

	[DIPOLE_MYSQL]
	LOG_FILE_NAME = dipmysql.log
	SQL_USER = totte
	SQL_HOST = gurka
	SQL_PASSWORD = totte
	SQL_DATABASE = mvlins
	SQL_TABLE = dipoles
	SQL_PORT = 3309

The dipolemysql module takes input from dipole-rotate.
Typically, the dipole-mysql is reading from a Fifo file and started as
	->cat Fifo1 | dipmysql -i./../config/Modules.ini
Where Fifo1 is a regular Fifo file.
